# Feature Specification: Fix npm run lint warnings mainly the unused variables

**Feature Branch**: `006-fix-npm-run`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix npm run lint warnings mainly the unused variables"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the budget planning application, I want to clean up all ESLint warnings, particularly unused variables, so that the codebase maintains high code quality standards and the development workflow is not cluttered with warnings.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current codebase has 149 ESLint warnings, **When** I run `npm run lint`, **Then** the output should show 0 warnings
2. **Given** there are unused variable warnings across multiple files, **When** I review the code, **Then** all unused variables should be either removed or properly utilized
3. **Given** there are unused import warnings, **When** I clean up the imports, **Then** only necessary imports should remain
4. **Given** there are prop validation warnings, **When** I fix component props, **Then** all props should have proper default values or be marked as required
5. **Given** there are XSS security warnings, **When** I review the v-html usage, **Then** the security concern should be addressed appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when removing an unused variable breaks functionality that was commented out?
- How does the system handle unused variables that are part of destructuring assignments?
- What if removing unused imports breaks future functionality that's planned but not yet implemented?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST eliminate all 149 current ESLint warnings when running `npm run lint`
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove or properly utilize all unused variables across all Vue components and JavaScript files
- **FR-003**: System MUST clean up unused imports and constants that are defined but never used
- **FR-004**: System MUST fix prop validation warnings by adding default values or marking props as required
- **FR-005**: System MUST address security warnings related to v-html directive usage
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality while cleaning up unused code
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure that removed unused variables don't break any commented-out or future functionality
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve code readability and maintainability during cleanup process

### Key Entities

- **ESLint Warnings**: Code quality issues identified by the linter that need to be resolved
- **Unused Variables**: Variables, functions, or imports that are declared but never referenced
- **Vue Components**: UI components that may contain unused props, computed properties, or methods
- **JavaScript Files**: Utility files, stores, and composables that may contain unused code
