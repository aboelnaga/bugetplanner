# Feature Specification: Run Linting and Fix Errors

**Feature Branch**: `004-feature-name-run`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "run linting and start fixing the errors and warnings"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What is the priority level for fixing different types of linting issues? ‚Üí A: Fix all errors first, then warnings (strict priority)
- Q: What should happen when linting errors require significant code refactoring that might break functionality? ‚Üí A: Skip errors that require major refactoring
- Q: What is the acceptable time limit for completing the linting fixes? ‚Üí A: 10 min
- Q: How should the system handle conflicting linting rules between different tools? ‚Üí A: Let developer decide case-by-case
- Q: What should happen with warnings that are acceptable and should be ignored? ‚Üí A: Update linting rules to ignore them

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Budgrt project, I need to identify and fix all code quality issues (errors and warnings) so that the codebase maintains high standards, passes all linting checks, and is ready for production deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project has linting errors, **When** I run the linting command, **Then** I can see all errors and warnings clearly identified
2. **Given** linting errors are identified, **When** I fix the errors, **Then** the code should pass linting without any errors
3. **Given** there are linting warnings, **When** I address the warnings, **Then** the code quality should improve and warnings should be reduced
4. **Given** all linting issues are resolved, **When** I run the build process, **Then** the project should build successfully without linting failures
5. **Given** the codebase is clean, **When** I make new changes, **Then** the linting should continue to catch new issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are conflicting linting rules between different tools? ‚Üí Let developer decide case-by-case
- How does the system handle linting errors that require significant code refactoring? ‚Üí Skip major refactoring errors
- What if some warnings are acceptable and should be ignored? ‚Üí Update linting rules to ignore them

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all linting errors in the codebase
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify all linting warnings in the codebase
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix all linting errors first (strict priority)
- **FR-004**: System MUST address linting warnings only after all errors are resolved
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure code passes linting without errors after fixes
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain code functionality while fixing linting issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear feedback on linting status
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle linting errors in Vue.js components
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle linting errors in JavaScript files
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle linting errors in TypeScript files
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure consistent code formatting across the project
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that fixes don't introduce new errors
- **FR-013**: System MUST update linting rules to ignore acceptable warnings

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST complete linting fixes within 10 minutes
- **NFR-002**: System MUST prioritize quick fixes over comprehensive refactoring

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Linting Error**: Represents a code quality issue that prevents proper execution or violates coding standards
- **Linting Warning**: Represents a code quality issue that should be addressed but doesn't prevent execution
- **Code File**: Represents a source code file that needs to be checked and potentially fixed
- **Linting Rule**: Represents a specific coding standard or rule that the code must follow
