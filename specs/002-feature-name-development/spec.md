**Feature Branch**: `002-feature-name-development`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "check the code base and packages and extract cursor rules and spec kit constitution principles to follow while developing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Extract and consolidate development guidelines from codebase
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: Cursor rules, Spec Kit constitution, Vue.js patterns, Supabase integration, Islamic finance compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Developers need consolidated guidelines
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for development team, not business stakeholders

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "development guidelines" without scope), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Scope of guidelines (frontend only, full-stack, specific features)
   - Target audience (junior developers, senior developers, all team members)
   - Format requirements (documentation, code comments, automated checks)
   - Integration requirements (IDE integration, CI/CD integration)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Budgrt budget planning application, I want a consolidated set of development guidelines that combines Cursor rules, Spec Kit constitution principles, and codebase patterns so that I can develop features consistently and maintain code quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer starting work on a new feature, **When** they reference the consolidated guidelines, **Then** they understand the project's architectural patterns and coding standards
2. **Given** a developer implementing Islamic finance features, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** their code complies with Sharia law requirements
3. **Given** a developer working with Supabase, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** they use proper MCP integration and RLS policies
4. **Given** a developer creating Vue.js components, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** they use Composition API patterns and proper TypeScript types

### Edge Cases
- What happens when guidelines conflict with each other?
- How does the system handle updates to guidelines when the codebase evolves?
- How are guidelines enforced during code review?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide practical development guidelines optimized for solo development and fast iteration
- **FR-002**: System MUST prioritize PrimeVue components and PrimeIcons over custom styling when possible
- **FR-003**: System MUST include Vue.js 3 Composition API patterns as preferred approach (not mandatory)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include Supabase integration patterns with practical error handling
- **FR-005**: System MUST include Islamic finance compliance requirements for Zakat and Hawl calculations
- **FR-006**: System MUST include TypeScript usage as preferred (not mandatory) for better development experience
- **FR-007**: System MUST include practical error handling patterns that don't slow down development
- **FR-008**: System MUST include real-time subscription patterns for Supabase integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST include component patterns that promote reusability without over-engineering
- **FR-010**: System MUST include state management patterns using Pinia stores
- **FR-011**: System MUST include package documentation references for quick lookup
- **FR-012**: System MUST include guidelines for when to add new dependencies vs using existing ones

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide guidelines for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: testing approach - should we focus on manual testing or gradually add automated tests?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance optimization - when to optimize vs when to ship fast?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Development Guidelines**: Consolidated rules and principles for consistent development
- **Codebase Patterns**: Established architectural patterns from existing code
- **Compliance Requirements**: Islamic finance and technical compliance standards

## Extracted Guidelines Summary

### Cursor Rules (from .cursorrules)
- **Project Context**: Vue.js budget planning application with Supabase integration
- **MCP Configuration**: Use Supabase MCP for database schema, API integration, and authentication
- **Development Guidelines**: Follow Vue.js best practices, use TypeScript, implement proper error handling
- **Database Requirements**: Users table, budget items, monthly amounts, budget history, RLS policies
- **API Integration**: Replace localStorage with Supabase, implement real-time updates, handle offline scenarios

### Spec Kit Constitution Principles (Adapted for Solo Development)
- **Islamic Finance Compliance**: All calculations must comply with Sharia law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Vue.js Best Practices**: Prefer Composition API, TypeScript when beneficial, focus on maintainable code
- **Supabase Integration**: Use Supabase MCP, implement RLS policies, replace localStorage gradually
- **Pragmatic Testing**: Focus on manual testing and critical path validation, add automated tests incrementally
- **User Experience Excellence**: Intuitive interfaces, clear financial data visualization, fast development cycles

### Codebase Patterns (from analysis)
- **Store Pattern**: Pinia stores with Composition API (useAuthStore, useBudgetCalculations)
- **Composable Pattern**: Reusable logic in composables (useBudgetCalculations, useIslamicLawCompliance)
- **API Layer**: Centralized Supabase operations in lib/supabase.js
- **Component Structure**: Vue 3 SFC with script setup, template, and scoped styles
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with practical error state management
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Supabase channels for live updates
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type safety when beneficial, not mandatory for rapid development
- **UI Components**: PrimeVue components with Tailwind CSS classes for customization

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, TypeScript (preferred), PrimeVue (primary UI), Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS, Sass
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing (when needed), manual testing for rapid development
- **Development**: ESLint, Vue TSC, Auto-import resolver
- **UI Components**: PrimeVue components and PrimeIcons (preferred over custom styling)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes (preferred over custom CSS)

### Islamic Finance Specific
- **Zakat Calculations**: 2.5% (1/40) calculation with proper Hawl management
- **Lunar Calendar**: Hijri date integration with moment-hijri
- **Nisab Thresholds**: Gold/silver price-based calculations
- **Hawl Management**: Lunar year tracking for Zakat obligations
- **Compliance Validation**: Islamic law adherence in all financial calculations

- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes, avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- **Icons**: Use PrimeIcons, avoid adding new icon libraries
- **Testing**: Manual testing for rapid development, add automated tests for critical features

- **Error Handling**: Keep it simple, don't over-engineer error states
- **Performance**: Optimize when you notice issues, not preemptively
- **Dependencies**: Prefer existing packages over adding new ones
