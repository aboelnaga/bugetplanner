## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for development team, not business stakeholders

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "development guidelines" without scope), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Scope of guidelines (frontend only, full-stack, specific features)
   - Target audience (junior developers, senior developers, all team members)
   - Format requirements (documentation, code comments, automated checks)
   - Integration requirements (IDE integration, CI/CD integration)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Budgrt budget planning application, I want to extract and consolidate the actual Cursor rules, Spec Kit constitution principles, and established codebase patterns so that I have a single source of truth for development guidelines that AI and human developers can reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to understand project rules, **When** they access the consolidated guidelines, **Then** they see the actual Cursor rules from .cursorrules file
2. **Given** a developer needs Islamic finance compliance, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** they see the actual patterns from useIslamicLawCompliance.js and useNisabCalculation.js
3. **Given** a developer needs Vue.js patterns, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** they see the actual composable patterns from useBudgetModals.js, useErrorHandler.js, etc.
4. **Given** a developer needs Supabase integration, **When** they follow the guidelines, **Then** they see the actual patterns from lib/supabase.js

### Edge Cases
- What happens when extracted patterns conflict with each other?
- How do we handle missing or incomplete patterns in the codebase?
- How do we add new pragmatic rules without conflicting with existing ones?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract actual Cursor rules from .cursorrules file and document them
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract actual Spec Kit constitution principles from .specify/memory/constitution.md
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract Vue.js composable patterns from existing composables (useBudgetModals.js, useErrorHandler.js, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract Islamic finance compliance patterns from useIslamicLawCompliance.js and useNisabCalculation.js
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract Supabase integration patterns from lib/supabase.js
- **FR-006**: System MUST extract PrimeVue component usage patterns from existing components
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract error handling patterns from useErrorHandler.js and other composables
- **FR-008**: System MUST extract state management patterns from Pinia stores
- **FR-009**: System MUST add pragmatic rules for solo development without conflicting with existing patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST update .cursorrules file with extracted rules and new pragmatic guidelines
- **FR-011**: System MUST update .specify/memory/constitution.md with extracted principles from codebase
- **FR-012**: System MUST consolidate all extracted rules into a single reference document
- **FR-013**: System MUST format rules for both AI consumption and human reference
- **FR-014**: System MUST include package documentation references for quick lookup

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: conflicting patterns - what to do when extracted patterns contradict each other?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: missing patterns - what to do when expected patterns are not found in codebase?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Development Guidelines**: Consolidated rules and principles for consistent development
- **Codebase Patterns**: Established architectural patterns from existing code
- **Compliance Requirements**: Islamic finance and technical compliance standards

## Extracted Guidelines Summary

### Cursor Rules (from .cursorrules - ACTUAL EXTRACTED RULES)
- **Project Context**: Vue.js budget planning application with Supabase integration
- **MCP Configuration**: Use Supabase MCP for database schema management, API integration, and authentication setup
- **Development Guidelines**: Follow Vue.js best practices, use TypeScript for type safety, implement proper error handling
- **Database Operations**: Use Supabase client for all database operations, implement real-time subscriptions where appropriate
- **Database Schema Requirements**: Users table (extends Supabase auth), budget items table with proper relationships, monthly amounts table for flexible data, budget history table for tracking changes, Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- **API Integration**: Replace localStorage with Supabase operations, implement real-time updates, add proper loading states, handle offline scenarios gracefully

### Spec Kit Constitution Principles (from .specify/memory/constitution.md - ACTUAL EXTRACTED PRINCIPLES)
- **Current Status**: Constitution file contains template placeholders, needs actual principles extracted from codebase patterns
- **Required Extraction**: Need to extract actual principles from codebase and populate constitution.md

### Codebase Patterns (ACTUAL EXTRACTED PATTERNS)
- **Composable Pattern**: All composables follow use[Name] pattern (useBudgetModals, useErrorHandler, useIslamicLawCompliance)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with useErrorHandler composable, toast notifications, error classification by type and severity
- **Islamic Finance**: Comprehensive Islamic law compliance with useIslamicLawCompliance.js supporting 4 schools of thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali)
- **Nisab Calculation**: useNisabCalculation.js with gold/silver price-based calculations

- **State Management**: Pinia stores with Composition API (useAuthStore, useBudgetCalculations)
- **API Layer**: Centralized Supabase operations in lib/supabase.js with real-time subscriptions
- **Component Structure**: Vue 3 SFC with script setup, template, and scoped styles
- **Constants Management**: Centralized constants in constants/budgetConstants.js
- **Utility Functions**: Centralized utilities in utils/budgetUtils.js

### Islamic Finance Specific (ACTUAL EXTRACTED PATTERNS)
