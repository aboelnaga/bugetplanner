# Multi-Year Budget Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of multi-year budget functionality for the Vue.js budget planning application with Supabase backend.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Added multi-year columns to `budget_items` table:
  - `is_multi_year` (BOOLEAN) - Flag for multi-year items
  - `linked_group_id` (UUID) - Links related items across years
  - `is_master` (BOOLEAN) - First item in group
  - `start_year` (INTEGER) - Start year of multi-year schedule
  - `end_year` (INTEGER) - End year of multi-year schedule
  - `end_month` (INTEGER) - Optional end month (defaults to December)

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Constants (`src/constants/budgetConstants.js`)
- ✅ `MULTI_YEAR_CONSTANTS` - Configuration constants
- ✅ `MULTI_YEAR_CALCULATION` - Calculation helper functions
- ✅ Updated `DEFAULT_VALUES` to include multi-year fields

#### Composables (`src/composables/useBudgetModals.js`)
- ✅ `updateMultiYearPreview()` - Real-time preview updates
- ✅ `handleMultiYearToggle()` - Toggle multi-year mode
- ✅ `validateMultiYearSettings()` - Multi-year validation
- ✅ `getAvailableYears()` - Year selection helpers
- ✅ `getAvailableEndYears()` - End year options

#### Store (`src/stores/budget.js`)
- ✅ `addMultiYearBudgetItem()` - Creates multiple linked items
- ✅ `getLinkedBudgetItems()` - Retrieves linked items
- ✅ `deleteMultiYearBudgetItems()` - Deletes all linked items
- ✅ `updateMultiYearBudgetItems()` - Updates all linked items

#### UI Components (`src/components/AddBudgetModal.vue`)
- ✅ Multi-year toggle checkbox
- ✅ Start/End year dropdowns with validation
- ✅ End month selection (optional)
- ✅ Real-time schedule duration preview
- ✅ Yearly breakdown preview
- ✅ Total amount calculation
- ✅ Smart defaults and validation

### 3. Business Logic

#### Amount Calculation
- ✅ **First year**: Partial based on start month
- ✅ **Middle years**: Full 12 months
- ✅ **Last year**: Partial based on end month (if specified)
- ✅ **Single year**: Custom start/end months

#### Example Calculations
```
Monthly $500 starting July 2024 for 2 years:
Year 1 (2024): $3,000 (Jul-Dec: 6 months × $500)
Year 2 (2025): $6,000 (Jan-Dec: 12 months × $500)
Total: $9,000

Quarterly $1000 starting January 2024 for 3 years:
Year 1 (2024): $4,000 (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct: 4 quarters × $1000)
Year 2 (2025): $4,000 (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct: 4 quarters × $1000)
Year 3 (2026): $4,000 (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct: 4 quarters × $1000)
Total: $12,000

Custom $200 (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec) starting July 2024 for 2 years:
Year 1 (2024): $400 (Sep, Dec: 2 months × $200)
Year 2 (2025): $800 (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec: 4 months × $200)
Total: $1,200
```

### 4. User Experience

#### Form Flow
1. **Basic Info** → Name, Type, Category
2. **Financial Details** → Amount, Investment Direction
3. **Investment Linking** → Link to existing investments
4. **Schedule & Timing** → Multi-Year Toggle → Schedule Options
5. **Preview** → Real-time breakdown and totals

#### Schedule & Timing Structure
```
Schedule & Timing
├── Multi-Year Budget Item (toggle at top)
├── [If Single Year]
│   ├── Recurrence (All options: Monthly, Quarterly, Bi-Annual, School Terms, Custom, One Time)
│   ├── Start Month
│   └── Custom Months / One Time Month
└── [If Multi-Year]
    ├── Start Year
    ├── Start Month
    ├── End Year
    ├── End Month (Optional)
    ├── Recurrence (Filtered: Monthly, Quarterly, Bi-Annual, School Terms, Custom)
    └── Schedule Duration Preview
```

#### Smart Features
- ✅ **Smart defaults**: Start year = selected year, End year = selected year + 4
- ✅ **Real-time preview**: Updates as user types
- ✅ **Validation**: Year ranges, duration limits, required fields
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Clear schedule duration and yearly breakdown
- ✅ **Intuitive UI**: Consistent gray styling, clear labels, helpful descriptions
- ✅ **Contextual fields**: Only show relevant options based on multi-year choice
- ✅ **Logical recurrence**: One Time excluded from multi-year (doesn't make sense)

### 5. Validation Rules

#### Multi-Year Validation
- ✅ Start year and end year are required
- ✅ End year must be after start year
- ✅ Maximum duration: 20 years
- ✅ Minimum duration: 1 year
- ✅ End month must be valid (0-11 or null)
- ✅ Start year cannot be in the past
- ✅ Start month cannot be in the past for current year

#### Amount Validation
- ✅ Default amount must be greater than 0
- ✅ Amount cannot exceed database limits
- ✅ Proper currency formatting and input handling

#### Date Validation
- ✅ **Current year**: Start month must be current month or later
- ✅ **Future years**: Start month can be any month (January onwards)
- ✅ **Past years**: Not allowed (start year must be current year or later)
- ✅ **End month**: Optional, defaults to December (month 11)

### 6. Database Operations

#### Multi-Year Creation
1. Generate unique `linked_group_id`
2. Create budget item for each year
3. Calculate yearly amounts based on schedule
4. Set `is_master: true` for first item
5. Link all items with same `linked_group_id`

#### Multi-Year Management
- ✅ **Edit**: Update all linked items simultaneously
- ✅ **Delete**: Remove all linked items
- ✅ **Duplicate**: Create new multi-year group
- ✅ **History**: Track changes across all years

### 7. Testing Scenarios

#### ✅ Valid Scenarios
- 5-year loan starting July 2024
- 3-year investment starting January 2025
- 2-year expense with custom end month
- Single year (multi-year disabled)
- Edit existing multi-year items
- Delete multi-year items (all linked items)

#### ✅ Error Handling
- Invalid year ranges (end before start)
- Duration too long (>20 years)
- Duration too short (<1 year)
- Missing required fields
- Database errors with rollback

### 8. Technical Implementation

#### Key Functions
```javascript
// Calculate yearly amount for specific year
MULTI_YEAR_CALCULATION.getYearlyAmountForYear()

// Calculate total across all years
MULTI_YEAR_CALCULATION.calculateMultiYearTotalAmount()

// Generate yearly breakdown for preview
MULTI_YEAR_CALCULATION.generateYearlyBreakdown()

// Create multiple budget items
budgetStore.addMultiYearBudgetItem()

// Validate multi-year settings
validateMultiYearSettings()
```

#### State Management
- ✅ Reactive form data with multi-year fields
- ✅ Real-time preview updates
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

### 9. UI/UX Features

- ✅ **Smart placeholders** and helpful descriptions

#### Responsive Design
